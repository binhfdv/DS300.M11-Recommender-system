## 1. Introduction and motivation
Lately, it has shown the great explosion of entertainment market, especially in music.
There are over 60,000 tracks are now uploaded to Spotify every day.
It means Spotify is seeing a new track uploaded to its platform every 1.4 seconds [[1](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/over-60000-tracks-are-now-uploaded-to-spotify-daily-thats-nearly-one-per-second/)].
Moreover, previous research [[2](https:gosling.psy.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/JPSP03musicdimensions.pdf)] has figured out the users preferred listening to music to doing any of other activities as watching television, reading books, and watching movies.
This leads to a need of developing a convenient, efficient and user-personalized recommendation system.
